# Research Software Encyclopedia

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/rse.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/rse)

The Research Software Encyclopedia (rse) is software to query and otherwise interact 
with a database of research software, and a research software taxonomy.
It is intended for research software engineers to be able to better qualify
and quantify the work that they do.

## Getting Started

The basic idea is that you interact with a database of software, which can
be generated locally in a flat file structure (with intention to add to version
control) or queried from a repository that serves one of these datasets.
The research software database, along with a taxonomy and criteria, can then
be queried in an interactive way to generate a research software encyclopedia.
